I was reading [Justin Jackson's post](https://justinjackson.ca/today) today. And he mentioned, "Founders should look for categories where folks are already spending money." And then, I stopped and analyzed a trend going on in the blogging community.  

One is membership blog sites. Yes, I can see a lot of blogs and websites are focusing on paid content or subscriber content. Wait, why are you telling me this now? I've started blogging platform previously, and I didn't lanch fully. So it's time to take the project, and let's see how it will go.

But I've already settled on this Hugo blog, but in the future, once I get the famous badge, I don't want to show the ad-block to my users; instead, I will be adding subscriber content. 

Also, today I've promised you to tell more about the Docs2Book as I promised on my previous blog post, but hey hang in there. I will continue that tomorrow.
