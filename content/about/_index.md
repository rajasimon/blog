# Hello there,

I'm Raja Simon. SuperCharged Coder and novoice blogger. I love writing technical blog posts. Most of them related to web application frameworks. Sometimes I write things about Javascript but I'm not that Js expert. Recently I love this [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator so occasionally you will hear me writing about Hugo too.

My motivation is for writing is to put my thoughts out there on the internet. So that people can find the answers they are looking for. If I'm searching for the answer that is not available on Google's first page then I will write that topic here.
