# Why I’m going to keep building Blogstreak
This idea comes after I’ve decided to put the pause of blogstreak web application development. When I decided to take the server offline I’ve had this thought why I’m going to delete the server and put the pause on this project. After I realised that I don’t need authentication for blogstreak. 

That’s like crazy idea and it’s another level because without authentication I need to make sure hacker don’t get access to the system. I mean I can do that because it’s all my system and the server and all of those things are in my own domain right so I don’t need to get around with csrf, cars and cookie which makes me happy.

For clapping I can make the request for every 10 claps or so and then disable the clap button for each reaquest in the backend I can check if the user is trying to bypass using the IP address.

For comment I can ask the user to enter their email address and upon successful email verification only I will show the content. That’s exactly what I want  but without authentication. 

In this week whenever I get free time I will work on this idea and to see if I can make the comment possible. If I can able to do it then I will be inviting the beta users.
