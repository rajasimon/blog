I'm starting this blog post to try Hugo static site generator and stumbled upon how incredible fast is this. Fast, meaning it's fast. 

Whenever I do Python Django runserver (I am using this framework for all of my prototypes), and it starts the development server in under a second. Still, this Hugo server is way under a millisecond, and that's fast. And I'm starting to wonder how fast GO language.

So let's write a few more blog posts for a few days and figure out what sticks.

Finally

Next time I will add subscribe form in my blog post. Until then keep an eye of this domain to see any blog post arrives.
