I never thought I would write this one after my [first blog post](/first-blog-post), but hey, it's my second post, and I already feel like a written lot of blog posts in the past.

I don't have the idea to pursue my next side projects. I was hoping you wouldn't ask me why I don't have it any more, and it's simple I can find anything. So instead of wasting time thinking about my next side project, I'm focusing on my previous two side projects. Revisiting one by one in the next few days to reiterate and launch. 

I heard that someone says before an Idea is not the matter; only the execution is matter. So I still believe that you don't have a million-dollar idea to build the next great product. Nevertheless, instead, you have to execute the concept clearly, and the success will follow. Today we will discuss the NoticeHire project.

### NoticeHire
This notice hire is my first side project. Among all hundreds of side projects, I've managed to launch this one in Producthunt and HackerNews and other r/sideprojects and one of my first failures too. 

It only receives nine upvotes. Wait, did I mention simple nine? Yes, it's not well received and around that time. I didn't realize why it's not received many because in my head, it was one of the best side projects, and that decided me to launch it.

The idea behind notice hire is HR people can hire good candidates faster by interviewing the people who currently in the notice period. I know it's a big space, and I remember getting candidates and human resources at the same time very tricky. 

But I see that promising candidates are joining into noticehire, well I had to follow and find the people who currently in notice period in LinkedIn.

New
So to avoid anyone who can join into Noticehire, I will charge candidates who are currently serving in notice period and letting them into Noticehire pool. This way, I can avoid spammers and can allow only genuine people who are currently serving in the notice period.
