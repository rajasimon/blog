This article comes from my own experience. I started writing recently and been publishing content over past few weeks. And I have made decent amount of money from it. I know it's not that big enough to convince you to start a blog but what I'm about to tell you is proven method. It's working for me and it will work for you too. So let's get started with these tips for how to make successful blog that geenrate revenue stream for you.

There is some fear in people who planning to start a blog whether it will be doing good or not. Don't feel that way. Instead of wasting time on thinking just write content and start publish. Believe me most people are not writing instead they are googling, so they will find you via search engine and you make money. Follow the rest of blog to find out what method you should follow to make money from blogging.

## Consistency

My number one advice is consistency. Yes you need to write a blog more frequently. More you write more people will notice your blog. More people seeing your blog will increase the search engine ranking so you will get more exposure over period of time.

My advice is try daily blogging. Spend one hour daily for blogging. It will compound over the period of time. So in 6 months or year you have considerably large blog site that draw more visitor from website.

If you're in the front page of any search that will give you minimum 10 to 20 visitors so what about good 100 blog post that will give you 1000 visitors and you will definitely earn money from it.

Daily blogging is great that you can share your content daily to different social platform to gain visitor. If you write blog daily then make sure you pick the topic not too boring so that you will never run out of ideas.

Weekly blogging is great for more technical stuff. You get more time in the weekdays to prepare or write few sentences. You can follow this weekly to write more in depth articles that will stand out in popular forums.

## Platform

Just pick the boring blogging for godâ€™ sake. If it's too easy to edit then you are probably designing something instead of putting the content first. So just pick the boring stack start writing soon.

I pick the Hugo static site generator to make a blog. It's great but it's not easy to modify the templates. So pick any Hugo theme and start making some few changes there then writing content. It's great markdown support and it's one of the best way to write content.

I know a lot of people are blindly choosing WordPress over some free alternative but I don't like the idea. Wordpress is great of e-commerce and other large site but for simple blogging I think you need to have simple blogging tool.

Just pick any static site generator and start publish content on netlify or other similar hosting provider. They offer some free that enough for basic blog site needs.

## Advertismenet

To make money by content the best option is Adsense. It's easy to get started but remember you need at least to have 30 + blog posts and updated blog site otherwise you will not get the approval.

Another great option other than Adsense is carbon ads but believe me it's not for freshers who just started. Please check their FAQ for eligibility to apply.

Other than the above methods your chance to make money is very less unless you write some quality content for the particular niche vertical topic. In that case affiliate will do better. You can use Amazon affiliates for this purpose.

## Paid Content

Recently paid content becomes a thing. Site like substack and patreon makes this possible but I don't see the point here. It's working for few with more general in depth analysis but normal blogger who just started please it's waste of time to start a paid blogging.

If you have the strong audience you believe then you can use Ghost. They have membership feature which is awesome. You can write free content and convert your users to paid users.

But remember paid subscription newsletter or blogging it will create a mental block that you need to publish content frequently so choose your topics wise or you need to research more in that topic. Overall make sure you ran out of ideas.

## Audience

Find where your niches are hanging out. And start posting your comments and build your trust in that community. Once you gain followers or when people recognize your profile they will share your blog post to their audience.

Analyse your blog post and find out where your link are performing. Sometimes the link will be doing well in HackerNews, Sometimes in Reddit. You need to find that and repeat what's working.

Start the newsletter very soon. People love hearing back from you. But you can avoid daily newsletter. I hate that daily newsletter idea. Weekly is the perfect for newsletter. But always it depends on your audience.
