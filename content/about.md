# Hello there,

I'm Raja. SuperCharged Coder who passion is to build awesome application. I love writing technical blog posts. Most of them related to Python web application frameworks. Sometimes I write things about Javascript but I'm not that Js expert. Recenlty I love this [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator so in next two weeks I will be writing some topics in that space.

My motivation is for writing is to put my thoughts out there on the internet. So that people can find answers they are looking. If I'm searching for the answer that is not available in Google first page then I will write that topic here. That's my blog title method. If you want me to write some topic then let me know by joining my Newsletter.
