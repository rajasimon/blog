# Hello there,

I'm Raja. SuperCharged Coder who passion is to build awesome application. I love writing technical in this blog. Most of them related to Django and other web application framework. Sometimes I write things about Javascript but I'm not that Js expert.

My motivation is for writing is to put my thoughts out there on the internet. So that people can find answers they are looking. If I'm searching for the answer that is not available in Google first page then I will write that topic here. That's my blog title method.

Disclaimer: Whatever I'm writing here is not related with my current employer.
