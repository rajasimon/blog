# Hello there,

I'm Raja Simon. SuperCharged Coder whose passion is to build an awesome application. I love writing technical blog posts. Most of them related to Python web application frameworks. Sometimes I write things about Javascript but I'm not that Js expert. Recently I love this [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator so occasionally you will hear me writing about Hugo.

My motivation is for writing is to put my thoughts out there on the internet. So that people can find the answers they are looking for. If I'm searching for the answer that is not available on Google's first page then I will write that topic here. That's my blog title method. If you want me to write some topic then let me know by joining my Newsletter.
